# Abstract

cl-annot-revisit is a re-implementation of [cl-annot](https://github.com/m2ym/cl-annot), an annotation library for Common Lisp.

The main motivation why I implemented it again is to split its concept to two parts:

1. Normal `defmacro`s acting like `export`, `doc`, etc in cl-annot. Overriding and rewriting forms can be implemented only with `defmacro`s conceptually.
2. `@` reader macro which just wraps forms with (), like `@foo bar` => `(foo bar)`.

Other motiviations are:

- Fix many bugs of cl-annot. (TODO: make a link)
- Show the funny *infinite* annotation I found. See `#@` syntax below.

I described those in [this article (Japanese)](http://y2q-actionman.hatenablog.com/entry/2019/12/20/cl-annot_%E3%82%92%E5%86%8D%E5%AE%9F%E8%A3%85%E3%81%97%E3%81%A6_cl-annot-revisit_%E3%82%92%E4%BD%9C%E3%81%A3%E3%81%9F) also.

# Before Using This...

I recommend to read articles below;

- Comments in [Reader Macros | Common Lisp - Bad Examples](https://www.reddit.com/r/Common_Lisp/comments/556mpn/reader_macros_common_lisp_bad_examples/), discussing this kind of reader macro.
- [Why I don't like eval-always](http://random-state.net/log/3387124996.html) and [I Still Don't Like EVAL-ALWAYS](http://random-state.net/log/3387296853.html), by Nikodemus Siivola.

Please consider these alternatives:

- The `nest` macro, introduced in [A tale of many nests](https://fare.livejournal.com/189741.html) by fare, to flat macro nestings.
- [How to Check Slots Types at make-instance](https://lisp-journey.gitlab.io/blog/how-to-check-slots-types-at-make-instance/) for saying CLOS slots as "optional" or "required".
- Just wrap your forms with `()` before trying `@` macro.

# Loading

cl-annot-revisit is not Quicklisp-ready now. 

At this time, clone this repository, locate it into
`~/quicklisp/local-projects/`, and:

``` common-lisp
(ql:quickload "cl-annot-revisit")
```

# Usage

## Macros 

`defun` and export its name.

``` common-lisp
(cl-annot-revisit:export
  (defun foo () t))
```

And, adding a docstring

``` common-lisp
(cl-annot-revisit:documentation "docstring"
   (cl-annot-revisit:export
     (defun foo () t)))
```

## '@' syntax

(stub)

### @(list) syntax

### @symbol syntax

`cl-annot-revisit-at-syntax:find-at-syntax-arity`

``` common-lisp
;; Enables @ syntax
(named-readtables:in-readtable cl-annot-revisit:at-syntax-readtable)

;; This is same as the nested example above.
@cl-annot-revisit:documentation "docstring"
@cl-annot-revisit:export
(defun foo () t)
```

### #n@(list) and #n@symbol syntax

### #@(list) and #@symbol -- *infinite* application
